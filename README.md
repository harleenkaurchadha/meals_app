# About app

In this we are going to make a meals app which lists various meals inside different categories based on their classification. On opening a particular meal we will be directed to a different screen which containes details about the meal its picture,ingredient list and complete step wise receipe to prepare it. We have an option to favourite a particular meal which we liked so that they can be easily accesed by going to favourites category in bottom bar of main screen , which will on tapping show the list of all the favourited meals. We have incorporated na option to filter all the meals based on the following categories:

1. Gluten- free
2. Lactose- free
3. vegetarian
4. vegan

on applying these filters by pressing the switch and tapping on save button in notification bar , we can get a filtered list of meals we want.
